So this is what I am learning in my new journey with learning react. 

Why write this?
The reason I am doing this journal is because I scouted the internet for simple turorials on react 
and all I found was nothing. So this is a system recording of all the things I learnt and learning in 
react and how it all assimilates together.

What is React?
What at all is react? It's simply something that gives you more additions and interactivity with 
your websites.
